# Operations playbook

Short reference for **latency**, **isolation concepts**, and **paths**.

## Doctor vs backend

- **`nexus doctor`** runs from CWD (no flags required to specify project root). There is no top-level `--timeout`; probes use internal timeouts.
- On startup, the CLI prints **`doctor: runtime backend=…`** so you know whether you are on **firecracker** or **seatbelt** (or other supported backend).
- **Firecracker, cold VM:** the first run can take **several minutes** (guest bootstrap, Docker/tooling) before your `.nexus/probe` scripts run. Silence is often normal.
- **Seatbelt** (common macOS fallback when nested virtualization is unavailable): usually **much faster** for the same project.
- Predicting backend: see `nexus create --backend …` and host capabilities. See [Workspace config](../reference/workspace-config.md).

## Isolation: fork vs workspace vs git worktree

| Mechanism | What it isolates | Typical use |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| **Git worktree** | Second checkout + branch on the **same machine** | Parallel features without branch switching in one tree. |
| **New Nexus workspace (`create`)** | Separate workspace id, runtime, and often VM | Remote execution, different repos/refs, clean processes. |
| **`fork`** | Child workspace derived from a parent (product semantics) | Experiment from a snapshot; check current docs for auth-bundle and metadata. |

Worktrees do **not** replace Nexus workspaces for remote sandboxes; they solve different problems.
