# Nexus Docs

Nexus gives you isolated VM workspaces with fast local iteration.

## Start in 2 Minutes

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inizio/nexus/main/install.sh | bash
cd /path/to/project
nexus init
nexus create
nexus list
nexus start <workspace-id>
```

`nexus create` prints the workspace id used by `start`, `ssh`, `tunnel`, and `stop`.

## Most Important Capabilities

- Firecracker-first isolation for stronger workspace boundaries.
- Docker inside the workspace VM by default.
- Mutagen sync keeps host work safe even if a VM is reset or corrupted.
- `nexus tunnel` provides quick manual testing of forwarded compose ports.
- Auth-forward and tooling bootstrap for opencode/codex/claude workflows.
- On macOS hosts without nested virtualization, runtime falls back to seatbelt.
